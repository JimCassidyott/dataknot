Read the recipe content that follows and extract all ingredients. Return them as a JSON dictionary using keys that follow the pattern "ING-0001" to uniquely identify each ingredient. Only list each ingredient once.
Guidelines:

If a recipe calls for "Pasta Base (Chickpea Pasta)", list "chickpea pasta" as the ingredient, not "pasta base"
"Chickpea" alone is not an ingredient since it describes the type of pasta
Exclude inedible ingredients from the list
Include only the ingredient name, not quantities or preparation notes
After creating your list, flag any questionably edible ingredients with a star (*)
Return only the JSON document with no explanations
